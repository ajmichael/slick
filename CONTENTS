bootboth.c runs the bootstrap statistics for both plane analysis
bootgrid.c runs the bootstrap statistics for the grid search inversion
bootslickw.c runs the bootstrap statistics for the linear inversion,
	and flips planes randomly
bothplanes.c makes a data file with both planes
controls include file that controls grid for gridfix.c and gridstrap.c
dirplg.c computes trend and plunge from a vector
dixie sample data file
dixieg sample data file in grid search format

plata.c program to plot data
plotbootg.c evaluates and plots confidence limits for grid search
plotboots.c evaluates and plots confidence limits for linear inversion,
   version that only plots some of the points to showing outer limits
   but not require lots of time to plot
plotbootso.c evaluates and plots confidence limits for linear inversion,
   version that plots all points
slfast.c fast version of slick with truncated output
slfast_sub.c fast version of slick with truncated output, subroutine version
slick.c linear inversion program
sort.c sorts a array of numbers (subroutine)
stridip.c finds strike and dip of a plane from the normal vector (subroutine)
switcher.c finds a new data set using the auxiliary planes of old data set
switchsub.c finds the auxiliary plane  and rake for one focal mechanism (subroutine)
